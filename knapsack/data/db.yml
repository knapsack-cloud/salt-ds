                    International Address Input is a pattern that gives users a set of form fields to input address
                    information for specific countries.

                    The pattern is a form that displays relevant fields for a user-selected location. You can use it to
                    provide consistent design when implementing International Address Input interactions across your
                    applications. Future versions of the pattern will cover the use of APIs, autocompletion and enhanced
                    support for more locations.

                    The pattern aims to accommodate users worldwide, but your team may be able to take further steps
                    that fall outside its scope. For example, check with your tech partners if it's possible to detect
                    user location and automatically adjust the form.

                    Use the pattern when your user needs to enter an address for a specific country. This could be for
                    shipping, contact, legal or compliance purposes, such as client onboarding flow or client detail
                    collection processes.

                    Dynamic format generates templates based on country or region. The templates only display fields
                    relevant to a specific country in a recognizable order and with familiar labels.

                    For the initial release, Dynamic format supports five countries: France, Germany, Spain, the United
                    Kingdom and the United States.

                    We recommend using templates in Dynamic format with localized language and terms that are more
                    familiar to the user. This will reduce barriers to input and minimize user errors.

                    A common navigation practice is to have the primary categories that represent the main sections of
                    your website or application in a vertical layout, usually placed on the left side of the screen.
                    These primary categories can expand to reveal secondary categories or subcategories when selected,
                    creating a hierarchical structure.

                    The number of vertical navigation levels depends on the complexity and depth of your website or
                    application's information architecture (IA). We recommended to be specific about your IA groupings
                    to avoid ambiguity. When navigation is limited to two or three levels, it allows users to quickly
                    navigate through the main categories and access the relevant subcategories or pages without
                    overwhelming them with too many choices. However, when your IA requires wider navigation, you can
                    extend it to more levels.

                    You can use a navigation item as a parent, which nests other navigation items inside it. Parent

                    with a versatile and efficient way to navigate complex content or features. It's ideal when your
                    experience comprises of multiple sub-apps, pages or sections which in turn also require their own
                    navigation.

                    to solve a specific business problem.

                    concise, allowing users to quickly scan the notification and understand the situation and/or next
                    steps.

                    To that end, our research team adopts an iterative approach, works to build on past findings, and
                    undertakes a constant evolution of research methods to support product needs.

                    One way in which we achieve rapid delivery of insights is by following method templates. These
                    define exactly who the participants are, the study design, what to measure and what to compare
                    outcomes against.

                    This practice means that we spend less time testing new components or patterns as they are
                    conceptualized. We can also compare outcomes to historic results and share insights in our technical
                    documentation when a new component or pattern is released.

                    Typically, the vertical navigation remains fixed in width when the user resizes the browser. You can
                    set it to the width of your choice but you should consider the overall label length, theme, density,
                    and the screen size you are designing for when making your decision.

                    When your application is responsive, the content area should use its own layout grid. As the user
                    adjusts their browser width, the navigation will remain fixed until reaching a specified breakpoint,
                    with only the content area adapting responsively based on the viewport.

                    The vertical navigation component can be configured for fully responsive application experiences.
                    Use the underlying layout grid to set a minimum width for your navigation pane and adjust your
                    content area based on your predefined breakpoints.

                    Navigation provides users with a structured and intuitive way to navigate different pages, sections
                    or features of your website or application. It tells users where they are at all times and ensures
                    they can easily get to where they need to go.

                    This pattern provides guidance for when and how to use navigation elements. The arrangement of
                    navigation elements depends on the complexity of the interface you are designing, the type of
                    content or features accessed and the overall user experience goals. Use this pattern to provide
                    consistency that helps users navigate your website or application easily and efficiently.

                  A digram depiciting a relationship between Design System, Creator/Builder and App Usability. The
                  design system, which provides rules, components, patterns and guidance, directly affects the usability
                  of selecting, interpreting and ultimately using those things for creators and builders. Their work in
                  turn directly affects the usability of apps they make, as does the design system, albeit to a lesser
                  extent.
