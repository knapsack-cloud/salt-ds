                    Salt is a pattern-driven system. This means we provide a set of simple, high-quality,
                    context-agnostic components and show you how to put them together in different ways, as “patterns”,
                    to solve a specific business problem.

                    We recognize the need for UI solutions that are tailored to line of business, product, or persona.
                    Salt Patterns provide you with solutions that you can use “out of the box” or easily modify to cater
                    for nuances in your product experience.
